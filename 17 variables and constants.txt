1- What is a Variable? And why do we need it?
A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds data which can be changed during program execution. We need variables to store and manipulate data dynamically in programs.
==========
2- What is a Constant? And why do we need it?
A constant is a value that does not change during the execution of a program. We need constants to define fixed values that remain the same throughout the program, ensuring consistency and preventing accidental changes.
==========
3- What is a Memory Cell?
A memory cell is the smallest unit of memory in a computer, typically storing one byte (8 bits) of data. It has a unique address and can hold binary information.
==========
4- What is an Identifier?
An identifier is a name given to variables, functions, classes, or other entities in a program. It is used to uniquely identify these entities within the code.
==========
5- What is a Memory Address? What is its relation to location?
A memory address is a unique identifier for a specific location in memory where data is stored. It relates to the physical or logical location in memory where the data resides.
==========
6- Which numbering system is used in memory address?
Memory addresses are typically represented in the hexadecimal (base-16) numbering system for simplicity and efficiency.
==========
7- Mention the primary types of variables?
The primary types of variables are:
1. Integer (int)	2. Floating-point (float)	3. Character (char)	4. Boolean (bool)
==========
8- What are the number's types? And give examples?
The main types of numbers are: Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3) , Floating-point: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
==========
9- What is a String? And give an example of it.
A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. It is typically enclosed in quotes. Example: "Hello, World!"
==========
10- What is a Boolean? And give an example of it.
A Boolean is a data type that can hold one of two values: true or false. It is used in logical operations and conditions. Example: bool isRaining = true;
==========
11- Are all variables and constants the same size?
No, size depends on data type.
==========
12- What happens when you use a much larger size than you need in variables?
Wastes memory, inefficient.
==========
13- Can we modify a variable during the program?
Yes, variables are changeable.
==========
14- Can we modify a constant during the program?
No, constants are fixed.
==========
15- How to make a variable read-only?
Use const or final keywords.
==========
16- Where do variables and constants get stored?
In memory (RAM).
==========
17- What is the difference between Integers and Floats?
Integers: whole numbers. Floats: decimal numbers.
